<p> I've loved sports ever since I was young. Through my school years I was always going 
from school to practice for all three seasons. During the fall, until my senior year, I 
played football as a free safety. I stopped playing halfway through my junior year, when I 
injured my LCL. This caused my to miss half of my wrestling season in the winter. I knew then
that wrestling was what I really enjoyed, so I turned my recovery into prepping myself for 
wrestling season. I continued to support my boys on the football team as we went to our third 
consecutive state championship and won our second consecutive championship.    </p>
