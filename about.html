<h2>Student at Maine Business School</h2>

<p>ABOUT
 

</p>

<p> Most people I've come across here at the UMaine are either in state, or from a nearby state. 
I however am from Brookfield, CT, which is a six hours away. I was drawn to UMaine due to 
the friendliness of most Mainers, the quality of UMaine's facilties, and pretty much just wanting 
to be on my own. I'm a dual citizen (Brazil & U.S), as I moved to the U.S with my family
when I was seven years old. In High School, I was a 5 time varsity letterman between Football, wrestling, and track.
I was also involved in business clubs such as DECA and Student Council a  As of right now I am
 Business Undeclared but I am certainly going to major in finance with a concentration in MIS.
   I want to one day be a financial analyst or Stock Broker. Besides from moving to the U.S, 
  I have not done much traveling, so hopefully my job is located somewhere interesting. 
I would love to work somewhere like Silicon Valley or Boston. </p>
